### Supported Frequencies by region

Check the list at [https://docs.flipperzero.one/sub-ghz/frequencies](https://docs.flipperzero.one/sub-ghz/frequencies)

### CAME 12bit 303 Mhz

CAME 12bit 303 MHz refers to a less common frequency and coding scheme used in some CAME remote controls for operating gates, barriers, and other automation systems.

### CAME 12bit 307 Mhz

### CAME 12bit 315 Mhz

### CAME 12bit 433 Mhz

CAME 12bit 433 MHz refers to another specific frequency and coding scheme used in CAME remote controls, similar to the 868 MHz version you mentioned previously.

### CAME 12bit 868 Mhz

**Applications:** CAME 12bit 868 MHz remotes are used with various CAME automation systems, including:

* Gate automation systems
* Barrier systems
* Garage door openers
* Lighting control systems
* Alarm systems

### Security+2.0\_390

Security+2.0\_390 is a specific protocol used in some garage door opener remotes, particularly those manufactured by LiftMaster. It operates on a frequency of 390 MHz and utilizes a more secure rolling code mechanism compared to older protocols like Security+ 1.0.
