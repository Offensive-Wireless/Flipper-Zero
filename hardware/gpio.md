# GPIO

The Flipper Zero GPIO stands for General Purpose Input/Output and consists of 18 pins on the top side of the device. These pins allow you to interact with various electronic components and modules, making them a powerful tool for tinkering, learning, and even professional applications.

### **Types of pins**

* **Power supply pins:** Provide power to external modules (3.3V and 5V).
* **I/O pins:** These are the main workhorses, allowing input (reading data) and output (sending data) to various components.
