#### Overview

Flipper Zero is a multi-functional tool that combines various hardware interfaces and technologies to interact with a wide range of devices and systems for security research and hardware hacking.

**Bluetooth**

Bluetooth capabilities allow Flipper Zero to connect wirelessly to other devices that use Bluetooth. This is useful for tasks such as analyzing and debugging Bluetooth communication protocols.

**NFC / RFID**

The Near Field Communication (NFC) and Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) features enable Flipper Zero to read and emulate NFC tags and RFID devices. This can be used for access control systems, contactless payment systems, and more.

**InfraRed**

The Infrared (IR) functionality lets Flipper Zero control devices that use IR for remote communication, such as TVs, air conditioners, and other consumer electronics.

**iButton**

iButton support enables Flipper Zero to interact with iButton contact-based identification devices commonly used in various access control applications.

**USB**

The USB interface allows Flipper Zero to connect to computers and other USB-enabled devices. It can be used for charging, programming, or acting as a Human Interface Device (HID) for keystroke injection attacks.
