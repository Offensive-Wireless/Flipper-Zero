# ðŸŸ¢ Modulations

#### Flipper Zero Modulations

Flipper Zero is a multi-tool device for pentesters and geeks, equipped with several radio and hardware protocols. Modulations played a central role in its function, enabling it to communicate across a wide range of frequencies and protocols.

**Common Modulation Types in Flipper Zero**

* **ASK (Amplitude Shift Keying):** This modulation changes the amplitude of the carrier wave to encode data, often used in RF remote controls.
* **FSK (Frequency Shift Keying):** FSK modulates the frequency of the carrier wave and is commonly used in data communication for modems, RFID, and other digital radio systems.
* **PSK (Phase Shift Keying):** A modulation that alters the phase of the carrier wave to transmit data. It is often used in wireless LANs, RFID, and Bluetooth communication.

**Modulation Applications in Flipper Zero**

* **RF Communications:** Flipper Zero can mimic remote controls and other RF devices by using ASK or FSK modulation to communicate with them.
* **Data Analysis:** The tool can analyze the modulation scheme used by a device to help understand its communication protocol.
* **Custom Protocols:** Users can create custom modulation schemes to communicate with niche or proprietary devices.

_For practical usage details or advanced configuration, please refer to the official Flipper Zero documentation or the active community forums._
