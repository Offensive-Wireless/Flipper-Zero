#### RFID at 125 kHz

RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) operating at 125 kHz is a type of low-frequency RFID system. The 125 kHz frequency band is used for proximity identification where read distances are on the order of a few centimeters up to a meter.

**Key Characteristics**

* **Frequency:** Typically 125 kHz or 134.2 kHz for Low Frequency (LF) RFID.
* **Read Range:** A few centimeters to approximately one meter.
* **Data Transfer Rate:** Lower compared to higher frequency systems.
* **Applications:** Animal identification, access control, and asset tracking.

**How It Works**

RFID systems consist of two main components: a tag and a reader. The reader emits a signal that activates the tag, which then transmits its data back to the reader.

**Advantages and Disadvantages**

* **Advantages:**
  * Good penetration through materials such as water and body tissues.
  * Relatively simple and inexpensive to manufacture.
* **Disadvantages:**
  * Slower data read rates.
  * Shorter read range necessitating close proximity to the reader.

#### Potential Attacks by Flipper Zero on 125 kHz RFID Systems

**Cloning RFID Tags**

* **Cloning**: Flipper Zero can capture and replicate the signal of a 125 kHz RFID tag, allowing unauthorized access by duplicating IDs.

Usage:

1. Scan the RFID tag with Flipper Zero.
2. Store the tag's data on the Flipper Zero device.
3. Emulate the tag or write its data to a writable RFID card.
