# Keyless entry systems

### Keyless Entry Systems

Keyless entry systems are a type of electronic lock that controls access to a vehicle without using a traditional mechanical key. Instead, they use a handheld fob that can be kept in a pocket or purse. The system works by sending a radio frequency signal from the fob to a receiver unit in the car, which unlocks the doors.

#### **How Keyless Entry Systems Work**

1. **Transmission of Signal**: When a button is pressed on the fob, it sends a coded signal by radio waves to the receiver unit in the car.
2. **Signal Reception**: The car's receiver unit detects the signal and checks the code.
3. **Unlocking Mechanism**: If the code matches, the system disengages the vehicle's locks.

### **Advantages of Keyless Entry**

* **Convenience**: Allows you to unlock your car without fumbling for keys.
* **Security**: The codes are often rolling codes, which change with each use to prevent code grabbing.
* **Hands-Free Operation**: Some systems detect the fob when it is closed and unlock the doors without any input.

### **Potential Risks**

* **Hacking**: There is a risk of hackers intercepting the signal to gain unauthorized access.
* **Battery Reliance**: Fobs are battery-powered and if the battery dies, the system may not function.

It's important to note that while keyless entry systems add a layer of convenience, they also require users to take steps to maintain security, like regularly changing batteries and ensuring the fob's security code has not been compromised.

### **Remote Keyless Entry (RKE)**

* This is the more basic system, similar to many other car brands.
* It uses a key fob that transmits a radio signal to unlock and lock the car doors from a distance, typically within a few meters.
* Some fobs may also have additional functions like opening the trunk or activating the alarm.
* Pre-2008 models usually use a 433.92 MHz frequency, while newer models use 434 MHz.

### **Hands-free Keyless Entry (HFKE)**

* This more advanced system, also known as "Renault Hands-free" or "Smart Entry & Start," eliminates the need for a traditional key fob.
* It uses a hands-free card or key fob that emits a low-frequency signal.
* As you approach the car with the card or fob in your pocket or purse, sensors in the door handles detect its presence and unlock the doors automatically.
* The engine can also be started by pressing a button on the dashboard while the card or fob is inside the car.
* This system typically operates on a 125 kHz frequency for communication between the card/fob and the car.
